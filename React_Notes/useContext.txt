📌 What is Context in React?

>> React Context is a way to share values (like themes, user authentication, language settings, etc.)
   across multiple components without passing props manually at every level.

>> Context is typically used for: 
    --> Themes (dark mode, light mode)
    --> Authentication (logged-in user data)
    --> Global State Management (alternative to Redux/Zustand)
    --> Language/Localization (i18n)

>> Syntax:-
                                const value = useContext(MyContext);
                                
   explanation:-
