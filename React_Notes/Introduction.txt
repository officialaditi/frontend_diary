                                     Introduction

React:-

==> React JS, is a popular open-source JavaScript library used for building UI.      
==> It is designed to make it easier to build reusable UI components that can be used throughout the application. 
==> The core idea behind React is to break down a UI into smaller, reusable components, each manages its own state
    and can be composed together to build more complex UIs.      
==> React uses a virtual DOM (Document Object Model) to efficiently update the UI in response to changes in the 
    application state without having to redraw the entire page.   

Feature:-

Component-based architecture:- --> React JS is built around the concept of reusable UI components that can be 
                                   easily composed to create complex interfaces. 
                               --> This makes it easy to build and maintain large-scale applications.

Virtual DOM:- --> React JS uses a virtual DOM, which is a lightweight version of the actual DOM. 
              --> This allows React to quickly update the UI by comparing the virtual DOM to the 
                  actual DOM and making only the necessary changes.

JSX:- --> React JS uses JSX, a syntax extension that allows developers to write HTML-like code in JavaScript.
      --> This makes it easy to build complex UI components in a familiar way.

One-way data flow:- --> React JS uses a one-way data flow model.
                    --> This means that data flows down from parent components to child components. 
                    --> This makes it easy to manage the state of an application and keep it in sync with the UI.

Unidirectional data flow:- --> With React JS, data flows in a unidirectional manner from parent components to child
                               components
                           -->  This helps to keep the data flow organized and makes it easy to understand how data 
                                is passed between components.
