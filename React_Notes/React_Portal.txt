                                      React Portal

>> A React Portal is a feature that allows you to render a component outside 
   its parent DOM hierarchy while keeping it within the React tree                                     

>> It helps when you need to render child components outside the main DOM hierarchy for styling or performance reasons,
   such as modals, tooltips, or pop-ups.
