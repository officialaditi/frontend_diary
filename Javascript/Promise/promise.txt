   Promise States:-

   A promise can be in one of three states:
   --> Pending: The promise is still in progress (not yet resolved or rejected).
   --> Resolved (Fulfilled): The promise has been successfully completed (the asynchronous 
       operation succeeded).
   --> Rejected: The promise has failed (the asynchronous operation encountered an error).


Basic Structure of a Promise: making of promise

an promise is created using [Promise] constructor and typically accept two function with 2 arugments
1) resolve => it an function only javascript created.
2) reject  => it an function that javascript created.

=> reject and resolve are the callback handle by javascript

const myPromise = new Promise((resolve, reject) => {

  // Asynchronous operation (e.g., setTimeout, fetching data)

  let success = true; // simulate success or failure
  
  if (success) {
    resolve("Task completed successfully!"); // Resolve the promise
  } else {
    reject("Task failed!"); // Reject the promise
  }
});

using of promise:-

Once a promise is created, we can use .then() for the resolved state and .catch() for the 
rejected state.

myPromise
  .then((message) => {
    console.log(message); // If the promise resolves
  })
  .catch((error) => {
    console.log(error); // If the promise is rejected
  });

Chaining Promises:-

You can chain multiple .then() methods to process the result step by step.

new Promise((resolve) => {
  setTimeout(() => resolve(10), 1000);
})
  .then((num) => {
    console.log(num); // 10
    return num * 2;
  })
  .then((num) => {
    console.log(num); // 20
    return num * 3;
  })
  .then((num) => {
    console.log(num); // 60
  })
  .catch((error) => {
    console.log(error);
  });

🔰 Mini Challenge for You!
Can you create a Promise that simulates downloading a file?

The Promise should take 3 seconds to complete.
If success is true, resolve with "📂 File downloaded successfully!".
If success is false, reject with "❌ Download failed!".
Handle it with .then() and .catch().
