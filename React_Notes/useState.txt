                         State:-

>> useState hook allow us to track the state in functional component.
>> Think of state as a component‚Äôs memory. 
>> It stores data that can change over time, like a counter, user input, or a toggle button.

üìå Example: Imagine a light switch

--> State: ON or OFF
--> When you press the switch, it changes state
--> The UI updates based on the new state

How State Works in React?
1Ô∏è‚É£ Define State: Use useState to create a state variable
2Ô∏è‚É£ Update State: Change it using setState (which triggers re-render)
3Ô∏è‚É£ React Updates UI: The component updates automatically when state changes

Example: Counter with State:-

import { useState } from "react";

function Counter() {
  const [count, setCount] = useState(0); // count = 0 initially

  return (
    <div>
      <p>Count: {count}</p>
      <button onClick={() => setCount(count + 1)}>Increase</button>
    </div>
  );
}

How It Works?
>> useState(0) ‚Üí Creates a state variable count with an initial value of 0
>> setCount(count + 1) ‚Üí Updates state when the button is clicked
>> React re-renders the UI with the new count

Key Takeaways
‚úÖ State stores data that changes over time
‚úÖ Updating state triggers a UI re-render
‚úÖ Use useState in functional components                     

                                        Update the array of content using useState;

>> Arrays are mutable in JavaScript, but when using React state, we should treat them as immutable.
>> We should not update the array directly using methods like push or pop when modifying state.
>> Instead, we should create a new array or copy the existing array, then use the setState function to update the state.

                                        Update the object of content using useState;

>> Objects are mutable in JavaScript, but when using React state, we should treat them as immutable.
>> We should not update the object directly by modifying its properties.
>> Instead, we should create a new object or copy the existing object, then use the setState function to update the state.
